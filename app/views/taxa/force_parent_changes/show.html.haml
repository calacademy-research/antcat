    %p It may not be possible to change the parent of this species, because this species has subspecies.
    %p
      This additional check was added since subspecies names are not updated, which can lead to names not agreeing with each other.
      Parent changes that does not change any species epithets should be OK.

          1) Clear parents of taxa that have been excluded from Formicidae (please also update the status in the taxon form to
          %code excluded from Formicidae
          if that is not already the case).
        %p
          2) Set a genus' parent to Formicidae if the genus is
          %i incertae sedis
          at family rank (please also set
          %code incertae sedis in
          in the taxon form to
          %code family
          if that is not already the case).
        %p 3) Correct obvious mistakes such as species that are listed in the wrong genus and never should have been there (homonyms, for example).
