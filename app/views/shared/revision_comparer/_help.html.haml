  Some changes are not logged, or may be attributed to the wrong editor.
  =inline_expandable "read more" do
    Changes are listed in reverse-chronological order. The first item points
    to the current version; all other changes correspond to a version object.
    Some actions rewrites the current version without creating new versions;
    this means that parts of the difference between revisions may be attributed
    to the wrong editor, and that timestamps may not be correct.

  ID tags in formatted taxt items are resolved
  according to the current database.
  =inline_expandable "read more" do
    For example, an item with the content "Subspecies of {tax 123}"
    may have said "Subspecies of <em>Lasius flavus</em>" at one point; if
    <em>L. flavus</em> is reclassified as a subspecies of <em>L. niger</em>,
    the formatted item will now read "Subspecies of <em>Lasius niger
    flavus</em>" -- even if you are looking at an much older revision --
    and it's not possible to tell that this has happened, because the content
    of the taxt item has not changed.
