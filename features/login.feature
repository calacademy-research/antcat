Feature: Logging in
  As a user of AntCat
  I want to be able to log in
  So I can edit references

  Scenario: Logging in successfully
    Given the following user exists
      |email            |password|password_confirmation|
      |email@example.com|secret  |secret               |
    Given I am not logged in
    When I go to the login page
      And I fill in "user_email" with "email@example.com" within "#page_contents"
      And I fill in "user_password" with "secret" within "#page_contents"
      And I press "Log in"
    Then I should be on the main page

  Scenario: Logging in unsuccesfully
    Given the following user exists
      |email            |password|password_confirmation|
      |email@example.com|secret  |secret               |

      And I fill in "user_password" with "asd;fljl;jsdfljsdfj"
      And I press "Go" within "#login"
