Feature: Reference field

  #Scenario: Setting a reference when there wasn't one before
    #When I go to the reference field widget test page
    #Then I should see "No reference selected"
    #When I add a reference by Brian Fisher
    #And I save my changes
    #Then I should see "Reference by Fisher selected"
