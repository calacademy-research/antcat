    When I visit the reference picker widget test page, opened to the first reference
    Then I should see "Fisher, B. 1995b. Fisher's book. Ants 1:1-2."

  Scenario: Searching
    When I go to the reference picker widget test page
    And I search for "Bolton"
    Then I should see "Bolton's book"
    * I should see "Fisher Bolton book"
    * I should not see "Bert's book"
    * I should not see "Fisher's book"

  Scenario: Searching for multiple authors
    When I go to the reference picker widget test page
    And I search for the authors "Bolton, B.;Fisher, B."
    Then I should see "Fisher Bolton book"
    And I should not see "Fisher's book"
    And I should not see "Bolton's book"

  Scenario: Editing the selected reference
    When I visit the reference picker widget test page, opened to the first reference
    When I follow "edit"
    #Then I should see the edit form
    #And I should not see the reference
    #When I fill in "reference_author_names_string" with "Ward, B.L.;Bolton, B."
    #And I fill in "reference_title" with "Ant Title"
    #And I press the "Save" button
    #And I wait for a bit
    #Then I should be on the references page
    #And I should see "Ward, B.L.; Bolton, B. 2010. Ant Title"
