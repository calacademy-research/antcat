Feature: Editing authors and author names
  As an editor of AntCat
  I want to edit/add/assign authors to names and vice versa
  So that they are correct

  Background: 
    Given the following names exist for an author
      | Bolton, B. |
      | Bolton,B.  |
    And these references exist
      | authors    | title          | year | citation   |
      | Bolton, B. | Annals of Ants | 2010 | Psyche 1:1 |
      | Bolton,B.  | More ants      | 2011 | Psyche 2:2 |
    And the following names exist for another author
      | Fisher, B. |
    When I go to the Authors page
    Then I should not see "Bolton, B." in the author panel

  Scenario: Searching for an author
    * I search for "Bolton, B." in the author panel
    * I should see "Bolton, B." in the author panel
    * I should see "Bolton,B." in the author panel
    * I should see "Annals of Ants" in the author panel
    * I should see "More ants" in the author panel

  Scenario: Searching for an author that isn't found
    When I search for "asdf" in the author panel
    Then I should see "No results found" in the author panel

  Scenario: Opening more than one search panel
    When I search for "Bolton, B." in the author panel
    And I search for "Fisher, B." in another author panel
    Then I should see "Bolton, B." in the first author panel
    And I should see "Fisher, B." in the second author panel

  Scenario: Searching for an author that's already open in another panel
    When I search for "Bolton, B." in the author panel
    And I search for "Bolton, B." in another author panel
    Then I should see "Bolton, B." in the first author panel
    And I should see "This author is open in another panel" in the second author panel

  Scenario: Closing a panel
    Given I search for "Bolton, B." in the author panel
    And I search for "Fisher, B." in another author panel
    When I close the first author panel
    Then I should see "Fisher, B." in the first author panel
    But I should not see "Bolton, B."

  Scenario: Merging
    Given I am logged in
    When I go to the Authors page
    And I search for "Bolton, B." in the author panel
    And I search for "Fisher, B." in another author panel
    And I merge the authors
