Feature: Expanding reference keys
  As an AntCat user
  When I see a short reference key
  I want to be able to click it and see the full reference
  So that I don't have to switch context to see the information I need

  Scenario: Expanding a reference key in the catalog
    Given the Formicidae family exists
    When I go to the catalog
    Then I should see the reference key "Latreille, 1809"
      #And I should not see the reference key expansion
    When I click the reference key
    Then I should see the reference key expansion
      #And I should not see the reference key "Latreille, 1809"
    When I click the reference key expansion
    #Then I should see the reference key "Latreille, 1809"
      #And I should not see the reference key expansion
