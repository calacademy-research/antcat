Feature: Editing references sections
  As an editor of AntCat
  I want to change previously entered taxonomic reference sections
  So that information is kept accurate and mistakes are fixed
  So people use AntCat

  Background:
    Given the Formicidae family exists
    And there is a subfamily "Dolichoderinae" with a reference section "Original reference"
    And there is a genus "Atta"
    And I log in

  Scenario: Editing a reference section
    When I go to the edit page for "Dolichoderinae"
    Then the reference section should be "Original reference"
    When I click the reference section
    And I fill in the references field with "(none)"
    And I save the reference section
    Then I should not see "Original reference"
    And the reference section should be "(none)"

  Scenario: Editing a reference section, but cancelling
    When I go to the edit page for "Dolichoderinae"
    And I click the reference section
    And I fill in the references field with "(none)"
    And I cancel the reference section's changes
    Then the reference section should be "Original reference"

  Scenario: Editing a reference section so it's blank
    When I go to the edit page for "Dolichoderinae"
    And I click the reference section
    And I fill in the references field with ""
    And I save the reference section
    Then I should see "References taxt can't be blank"

  Scenario: Adding a reference section
    When I go to the edit page for "Atta"
    Then the reference section should be empty
    When I click the "Add" reference section button
    Then I should not see the "Delete" button for the reference section
    When I fill in the references field with "New reference"
    And I save the reference section
    And I wait for a bit
    Then the reference section should be "New reference"

  Scenario: Adding a reference section with blank taxt
    When I go to the edit page for "Atta"
    Then the reference section should be empty
    When I click the "Add" reference section button
    And I save the reference section
    Then I should see "References taxt can't be blank"

  Scenario: Adding a reference section, but cancelling
    When I go to the edit page for "Atta"
    And I click the "Add" reference section button
    And I cancel the reference section's changes
    Then the reference section should be empty

  Scenario: Deleting a reference section
    When I go to the edit page for "Dolichoderinae"
    And I click the reference section
    Then I should see the "Delete" button for the reference section
    Given I will confirm on the next step
    When I delete the reference section
    And the reference section should be empty
