  Scenario: Adding a protonym with a type name
    Given there is a genus "Atta"
    And this reference exists
      | author   | year |
      | Batiatus | 2004 |

    When I go to the protonyms page
    And I follow "New"
    And I set the protonym name to "Dotta"
    And I pick "Atta" from the "#protonym_type_name_attributes_taxon_id" taxon picker
    And I pick "Batiatus, 2004" from the "#protonym_authorship_attributes_reference_id" reference picker
    And I fill in "protonym_authorship_attributes_pages" with "page 35"
    And I select "by monotypy" from "protonym_type_name_attributes_fixation_method"
    And I press "Save"
    Then I should see "Protonym was successfully created."
    And I should see "Type-genus: Atta, by monotypy"

    When I follow "Edit"
    And I select "by original designation" from "protonym_type_name_attributes_fixation_method"
    And I press "Save"
    Then I should see "Protonym was successfully updated"
    And I should see "Type-genus: Atta, by original designation"

  Scenario: Adding a protonym with errors
    When I go to the protonyms page
    And I follow "New"
    And I select "by monotypy" from "protonym_type_name_attributes_fixation_method"
    And I press "Save"
    Then I should see "Name can't be blank"
    And I should see "Authorship: Reference must exist"
    And I should see "Authorship: Pages can't be blank"
    And I should see "Type name: Taxon must exist"

  Scenario: Adding a protonym with unparsable name, and maintain entered fields
    When I go to the protonyms page
    And I follow "New"
    And I set the protonym name to "Invalid a b c d e f protonym name"
    And I press "Save"
    Then I should see "Protonym name: Could not parse name Invalid a b c d e f protonym name"
    And the "protonym_name_string" field should contain "Invalid a b c d e f protonym name"

  Scenario: Editing a protonym
    Given there is a species protonym "Formica fusca" with pages and form 'page 9, dealate queen'

    When I go to the protonyms page
    And I follow "Formica fusca"
    Then I should see "page 9"
    And I should see "dealate queen"

    When I follow "Edit"
    And I fill in "protonym_authorship_attributes_pages" with "page 35"
    And I fill in "protonym_forms" with "male"
    And I fill in "protonym_locality" with "Lund"
    And I select "Malagasy" from "protonym_biogeographic_region"
    And I press "Save"
    Then I should see "Protonym was successfully updated"
    And I should see "page 35"
    And I should see "male"
    And I should see "LUND"
    And I should see "Malagasy"

    When I follow "Edit"
    Then I fill in "protonym_authorship_attributes_pages" with "page 35"
    And I fill in "protonym_forms" with "male"
    And the "protonym_locality" field should contain "Lund"

  Scenario: Editing type fields
    Given there is a genus protonym "Formica"

    When I go to the edit protonym page for "Formica"
    And I fill in "protonym_primary_type_information_taxt" with "Madagascar: Prov. Tolliara"
    And I fill in "protonym_secondary_type_information_taxt" with "A neotype had also been designated"
    And I fill in "protonym_type_notes_taxt" with "Note: Typo in Toliara"
    And I press "Save"

    And I should see "A neotype had also been designated"
    And I should see "Note: Typo in Toliara"

  Scenario: Editing a protonym with errors
    Given there is a genus protonym "Formica"

    When I go to the edit protonym page for "Formica"
    And I fill in "protonym_authorship_attributes_pages" with ""
    And I select "by subsequent designation of" from "protonym_type_name_attributes_fixation_method"
