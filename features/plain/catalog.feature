Feature: Using the catalog
  As a user of AntCat
  I want to use the catalog in both index and browser modes
  Depending on my needs

  #Scenario: Keeping search results after going to the browser
    #When I fill in the search box with "emeryi"
      #And I press "Go" by the search box
      #And I choose "Browser"
    #Then I should see "Tapinoma emeryi" within the search results
      #And I should see "Atta emeryi" within the search results
