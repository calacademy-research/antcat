Feature: Seeing what's new
  As a user of AntCat
  I want to see recently added references
  So I can keep up with the state of the literature

  Scenario: See features in order of addition
    Given the following references exist
      |authors   |citation  |created_at|title            |created_at|updated_at|year|
      |Ward, P.  |Psyche 5:3|today     |Ward's World     |2010-2-2  |2010-1-1  |2010|
      |Bolton, B.|Psyche 4:2|yesterday |Bolton's Bulletin|2010-1-1  |2010-2-2  |2010|
    When I go to the references page
      And I follow "Latest additions"
    Then I should see these entries with a header in this order:
      |date      |entry|
      |2010-02-02|Ward, P. 2010. Ward's World. Psyche 5:3.|
      |2010-01-01|Bolton, B. 2010. Bolton's Bulletin. Psyche 4:2.|
