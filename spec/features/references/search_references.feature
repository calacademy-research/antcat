  Scenario: Searching for an author name with diacritics, using the diacritics in the query

      | author         |
      | Hölldobler, B. |
      | Fisher, B.     |
    And I go to the references page

    And I click on the reference search button
    Then I should see "Hölldobler, B."
    And I should not see "Fisher, B."
