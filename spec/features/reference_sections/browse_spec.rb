  Background:

  Scenario: Filtering reference sections by search query
    Given there is a reference section with the references_taxt "typo of Forel"
    And there is a reference section with the references_taxt "typo of August"

    When I go to the reference sections page
    Then I should see "typo of Forel"
    And I should see "typo of August"

    When I fill in "q" with "Forel"
    And I press "Search"
