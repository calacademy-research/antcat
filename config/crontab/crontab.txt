# TODO: May not be used. We should probably start using it unless we
# already do. Either way, this file should be updated.

# This is the output of crontab -l on production
# It reindexes the Solr fulltext database every 24 hours
# at 7am UTC = midnight PST
# This crontab is overwritten each time Engine Yard's "Apply" button
# is clicked, so it must be replaced after that
#
# To replace this functionality after an "Apply",
# 1) Log onto server
# 2) sudo su
# 3) crontab -e
# 4) Append the bottom two lines of this file to the crontab listing and save

# DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE - edit the master and reinstall.
