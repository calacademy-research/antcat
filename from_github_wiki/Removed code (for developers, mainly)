https://github.com/calacademy-research/antcat/wiki/Removed-code-(for-developers,-mainly)

Mention/link commits here that removed features, or commits that may be worth mentioning for other reasons, for example large migrations. Maybe. This is not meant to be a complete change log -- we do not have to bookkeep for the sake of bookkeeping -- but having a place where developers and non-developers can see these changes is good.
